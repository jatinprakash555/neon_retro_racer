📖 About
Neon Racer: Ultimate is a browser-based 3D arcade racer where players speed through an infinite, procedurally generated neon city. The game features a custom physics engine for acceleration and drifting, dynamic difficulty scaling, and a fully procedural soundtrack generated in real-time using the Web Audio API (no external audio files required).
